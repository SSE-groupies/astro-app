## Master repo linking to all microservices
### Flexible and scalable web app prototype to add stars to a visualisation of the night sky whilst sharing deep thoughts/questions and creating constellations with others

#### Project Ideas:
##### Star App Features:
- Add star to night sky, including a personal message of your thoughts
- Add friends
- Timer of e.g. an hour to wait until you can add more people
- Task to unlock the possibility to add a new star in order to make it challenging
- Questions - educational, about astronomy, to win points in order to add a new star
- Question that user writes (to create a “question star”) can be answered by another user, which could like their stars into a constellation
- Upvoting but for stars, otherwise they fade away gradually over time 
- Stars displayed over browser (web GL)
- Could have flat, scrollable page like agar.io
- Could have hemisphere, like human looking up at the sky, where everyone is assumed to stand at same point
- Harder version possible is to create a version where you can move, and hemisphere positioning moves if you travel
- When you click on a star, you dynamically do an animation-style zoom in and the text that the person wrote when they created the star would be shown
- Graphics running shader code to simulate either a hemisphere or a globe
- Music aspect - e.g. background ambient music similar to Google Earth VR/Monument valley
- Sound effects - e.g. twinkle/ding noise when a new star is added, or new constellation is formed
